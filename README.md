# ChatBot-with-TensorFlow-
In this project I used Cornell movie corpus data set which contains more than 600 movies containing thousands of conversations between lots of characters. 
we will train our chatbot on this data set because we want to build a general chat bot that can have a general converstion with people.
instead of soecified chat bit this is used for some specific purpose. the model that we will use can be trained on other datasets for some other purposes.
for example will be abke to train the same chat bot on a more specific dataset like a calendar assistant or navigation assistant. 

The implementation of this chatbot is divided in five parts, you can check out the code for each part for more understanding
## 1. PART ONE: 
### DATA PREPROCESSING:
   this part involves different steps like importing of libraries, importing of data and cleanining. for more information about cleaning this data you can check out my [repo](https://github.com/Desire100/Cleaning-Cornell-Movie-Corpus-Data) named cleaning Cornell movie dataset. 

## 2. PART TWO - BUILDING A SEQ2SEQ MODEL:

   In this part we built the  archetecture of our seq2seq model by using tensorflow library.
