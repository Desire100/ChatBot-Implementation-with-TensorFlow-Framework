# ChatBot-with-TensorFlow-
Cornell movie corpus data set which contains more than 600 movies containing thousands of conversations between lots of characters. 
we will train our chatbot on this data set because we want to build a general chat bot that can have a general converstion with people.
instead of soecified chat bit this is used for some specific purpose. the model that we will use can be trained on other datasets for some other purposes.
for example will be abke to train the same chat bot on a more specific dataset like a calendar assistant or navigation assistant.
